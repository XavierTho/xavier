## Reflection
My team and I had a great experience at N@M where we were able to showcase the project in which we were working on for many a month. There were a surprising amount of individuals who showed that of great interest into our game and likewise the experience of playing it. But, as much as I like reminiscing on what went well, I'd be doing a disservice to myself if I don't illustrate the many things that should've been that weren't. One such thing would be the aggrecious amount of lag incurred upon the multiplayer system due to the amount of people who were playing the game at the same time. I'm not exactly sure how this could've been improved, I was not behind the code for such, however what I do know, is that it certainly took away from the experience when the player is moving at 0.1 pixels a second. The very thing to which is multiplayer, that was supposed to be the highlight of our game, ended up being the preceder to our success.

Other such issues includes the complete destruction of the Goomba code by individuals who knew not what they were doing due to their lack of extensive testing and issues with other assets and features of the game that could've been, should've been, fixed. The issues in it of themselves weren't inherently hard to fix, but either miscommunication or lack of care, caused the code to be lesser than its full potential. The simple solution of all of this is TEST TEST TEST, and that the management team also TESTS TESTS TESTS. But you know, coulda woulda shoulda. Besides this, the game was great. Our features, being platforms, coins, enemies, the lucky block, and more, served as fundamental assets to the game, that captivated our audience in ways without such, they would not be so entertained.

## Other Teams
Our project, while certainly a well-made, functional game, made by 20+ people, we weren't the only impressive thing to be seen at N@M. One such example of another well-made project was called AtlasIndex. It was essentially a basic economically inclined website, where one could buy houses, crypto currency, and stocks. It was simulated to give the user a realistic experience of such transactions. There wasn't anything more to it, but the idea was really interesting, and so was their implementation.
