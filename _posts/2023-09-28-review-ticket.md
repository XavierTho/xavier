- **Self Grade: 5/5**

Reasoning: I did the most work in my group, doing a total of 4 sections for the web programming test, while others in my group did 1 or 0 sections (the reason for this is some people couldn't finish to the point of the deadline). I also managed and oversaw the finalization of everyone's repository, by constant reminders in Slack to publish their code and then add and review each other's code in order to do as well as possible for the test. Additionally, I spent a lot of time on this test, time in which I needed for other pressing responsibilites but due to a lack of work being done, I took it upon myself to do what I could to get the best possible grade for my team.

Also, for the sections that were managed by others in my group, it was not made without major revisions made by myself to add much more quality to the section.

- **Peer Grade: 4.8/5**

Reasoning: I'm assuming Peer Grade means I'm grading my parnter, Daniel. I'm giving him a 4.8/5 for the following reasons. While Daniel has only contributed one section to this project, a section that had to be modified and refined be myself, he is always focused during class and makes an effort to understand the code and develop a better grasp on concepts taught in class. He doesn't do work at home, but he is also very busy, so I appericate the work that he does manage to get done. It's for these reasons, the constant effort he tries to give this class that I am giving him the high grade that I am.

- **Team Grade: 3/5**

Reasoning: Our team, as a whole, needs signficant improvement if we are to succeed in this class. What I will say is that it's of much frustration when individuals aren't focused or putting in the necessary effort they should as members of this team. Such examples includes reading two classes in a row instead of spending all that time improving unfinished code and just not being present at all in the class and doing things for other classes or just something else entirely. This is why our team grade is so low. It's not sustainable to continue such practices and we must improve immediately.

### Code Review!
Reviewing Justin's code: 
- Justin's code respectfully works and is organized in the approriate manner. However it lacks a certain level of creativity. The code has no character and it isn't necessarily interesting to read. What I would recommend for Justin in the future is to pick an interesting theme in which he can base his code off rather than two random hyperlinks about a chinese story and song.
