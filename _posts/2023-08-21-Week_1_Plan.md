### Summary of the Week
This week, I published my website so it would be accessible through github.io. Additionally, not only did I add more content to my website but I also made it look more aesthetically pleasing. I took a lot of time in understanding how to change the CSS of my website and recorded my findings into a guide/hack that is now one of many blogs that I have. I added the "Tech Journey" blog, explaining my journey into technology, and I added images across the website to give it more personality.
