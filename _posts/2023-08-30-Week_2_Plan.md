### Summary of the Week
This week, I setup my lab notebook where I would store all of my accomplishments and plans for the class. Once I setup the table for my notebook, I began working on various plans and hacks to populate the table with. Additionally, I learned how to add basic games into my website. The ones I chose were Snake & Conway's Game of Life.
