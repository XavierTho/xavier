#### Preliminary Note
This hack will be used to record the process us installing and setting up tools for Windows 10. It should be used as a reference (for me) if in fact, I should need to repeat any of these steps.

### VSCode
1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Installer asks to Select Additional Tasks, check “Add to PATH”.
3. Add "Remote Development extension pack" in VSCode

### WSL
1. Go to Powershell as an admin and download WSL:  `wsl --install`
2. Restart Computer
3. Command prompt will show up; enter a username and password
