1. Install all necessary tools *(DONE)*
2. Make a github account *(DONE)*
3. Clone student github repository *(DONE)*
4. Edit files and make them personal *(DONE)*
5. Host the website on your device *(DONE)*

### Summary of the Week
This week I installed and setup all the necessary tools for CSSE. This includes VSCode, Java, Python, & WSL. I also setup a github account which I would use to clone the student github repository and connect that repository to VSCode where I would be able to edit the code from my device. Once I got the files into VSCode, I started editing and playing around with different files, seeing what they did and trying to personalize the website. I was able to view these changes by figuring out how to host the website on my device.
