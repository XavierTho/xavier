## Freeform Picture
<img align="center" style="border:10px outset silver;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/freeform.png" height="400px" alt="freeform"/>


This is my freeform picture, comprised of 6 images, representing different aspects of my life. The first half represents parts of my identity as an individual, while the second half is focused on the impact technology has had on my life. With these images, I shall tell the story they behold.

I am from San Diego, California, and have been raised here for the entirety of my life. To whom have raised me, that would be my parents of course. I live with my mom, dad, sister, and dog (refer to the second picture for of my family). My dad is Jamaican, while my mom is Filipino, making me a mix of both. This heritage and my nationality of American is an interesting mix to say the least. 

Besides such information, I have a passion for computers, and such can be shown in my participation in a competition called CyberPatriot. I have been competing in this competition, under the group CyberAegis for a little over a year now, and I find much joy in it. In the competition, I specialize as a Windows main, meaning I'm tasked in securing Windows machines and critical services that are used in Windows. In CyberAegis, I also get to compete in other competitions such as the SGC and SoCal Cyber Cup, all in which helps me better understand cybersecurity and technology as a whole.

| 0        | Github & Tools  | Downloaded tools necessary for CSSE and set up a github page. The whole process, at least for myself didn't serve to be much of an issue thanks to a bit of previous experience. Most issues I had were solved within 10-30 minutes after a bit of investigation.  |
| 1        | Markdown Page   | We designed our websites to contain content and to have an aesthetically-pleasing look. We did this by filling our websites with pictures about us and talking about ourselves from there. We also tested with different themes and changed the css to our liking. |
