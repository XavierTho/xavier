## Freeform Picture
![freeform picture]({{site.baseurl}}/images/freeform.png){:height="400px"}

This is my freeform picture, comprised of 6 images, representing different aspects of my life. The first half represents parts of my identity as an individual, while the second half is focused on the impact technology has had on my life. With these images, I shall tell the story they behold.

I am from San Diego, California, and have been raised here for the entirety of my life. To whom have raised me, that would be my parents of course. I live with my mom, dad, sister, and dog (refer to the second picture for of my family). My dad is Jamaican, while my mom is Filipino, making me a mix of both. This heritage and my nationality of American is an interesting mix to say the least. 

Besides such information, I have a passion for computers, and such can be shown in my participation in a competition called CyberPatriot. I have been competing in this competition, under the group CyberAegis for a little over a year now, and I find much joy in it. In the competition, I specialize as a Windows main, meaning I'm tasked in securing Windows machines and critical services that are used in Windows. In CyberAegis, I also get to compete in other competitions such as the SGC and SoCal Cyber Cup, all in which helps me better understand cybersecurity and technology as a whole.

## Journey into Technology

### Phase 1 (2017-2020)
My introduction into technology isn't an interesting one. I merely found computers fascinating and from a certain point on, I started playing around with different features on my computers. For these first three years, I didn't progress much. Most of this time was spent learning applications such as Google Slides and Google Docs, as that was the extent of my knowledge.

### Phase 2 (2020-2021)
In phase 1, something that I didn't mention was in that time I heard of a group called CyberAegis who competed in a national competition called CyberPatriot. They just so happened to be consistent national champions that were made of students in Oak Valley, Design39, and Del Norte. At that time, I kept it in mind but couldn't get into the group due to still being in elementary school. Once I got into 6th grade, I signed up for the group. CyberAegis has a process in which new students must go through what they call the 'Farm League.' Here, the basics of the competition is laid out, and once such information is shared, we are given virtual images to secure. All of this is meant to prepare us for the *Tryouts* where around half of the students are selected to join the actual group. Well, to put it bluntly, I didn't didn't get as my scores were less than impressive. At that time, I didn't put in much work and thought I could get into the group without trying. Well I was proven wrong and would have to wait a year till I could get another chance.

A year later, in 2021, I was given another opportunity. This time, I made sure to make use of such. Barely, and I mean just barely, I made it on the team. This, right here, was a turning point not only in terms of my path in technology, but the path of my life. If I were to choose any defining moment in my life, this would be it.

### Phase 3 (2022-Present)
Phase 3 is where the investments of the past paid its long awaited interest. Now that I was on the team, the path forward was much more clear. However, equally so, things became even more confusing than before. I was being introduced and taught material so foreign and so inherently difficult, nothing I had ever seen before, it was hard to keep up. And so, the grind commenced. Many hours a day I invested in this summer, trying to get my head around all the different material. Only a few months from this point, the ICC (In-Class Competition) would commence, which would prove vital in the team I'd end up getting on. Based on ICC scores, leaders of teams choose who they would invite onto their team. The higher the score, the better. And so, as a windows main, I had to excel in Windows if I had any chance of getting on a team capable of going to the nationals finals of CyberPatriot.

And so, the day came. Once again, just like the Farm League, I would be tested on all the work that came before, and to see if it was truly enough. The day came, and the image that were given to secure is the hardest image I've ever gotten. Harder than even the actual images in the real competition. Schools across the board were low. 45/100 was the max score given. I could only hope my performance was enough.

### Phase 3.25 (My Team)

*1 Day Later...*
I got a message in discord, by a leader of one of the best teams in Oak Valley. I was thrilled! My ICC scores for windows was one of the best in my school. I messaged back, "I'd love to join, but I'd like to wait to see if any other options become available." They responded saying that I would have to find out soon or else they'd have to find someone else. At that time, I was messaged by another leader in Oak Valley of a very good team as well. And so, now I had two different teams to choose from, that were both exceptionally talented. Only one of these teams could make it to the Nationals, as by the rules, and so these teams in the end would fight for such a spot, and it would likely be very very close... Who'd I end up choosing? Well, I chose the second option, lead by Mihir Bapat, the captain of the group. He was quite convincing why I should join him instead of the other team, and I made the very hard decision of choosing his team rather than the other, a decision that would be decisive later on.

To recap, I just made it on the Farm League and only a few months later, I was selected onto one of the best teams in my school. It was very exciting but equally stressful. The level of responsibility had risen tenfold, and soon we would be competing in the actual competition, where nothing but exceptionally performance would guarantee our success.

My Team:
- Networking: Jacob Wu
- Linux: Dhyan Soni & Aditya Katre
- Windows: Mihir Bapat, Kanhay Patil, & Xavier Thompson
