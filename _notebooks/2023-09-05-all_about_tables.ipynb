    "```\n",
    "| Number      | In Binary   |\n",

    "| 2           | 00000010    |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "1. `<table>` - Indicates the start and end of the HTML table.\n",

The *<table>* cell indicates the start and end of tables and all information about the table must be contained with this cell. Further in, there is the *<tr>* cell, which organized separate cells into their own mini groups. You can see from the example above that the table headers are separate from the watches and the watches are separate from each other. \n",
