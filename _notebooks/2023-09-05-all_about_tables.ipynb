    "| 2           | 00000010    |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, making these tables are quite tedious and really a waste of time. Alas, there is a solution! Instead of actually coding a markdown table as that takes up too much time, there are markdown table generators where you can design a table as if it were a spreadsheet.\n",

The *<table>* cell indicates the start and end of tables and all information about the table must be contained with this cell. Further in, there is the *<tr>* cell, which organized separate cells into their own mini groups. You can see from the example above that the table headers are separate from the watches and the watches are separate from each other. \n",
