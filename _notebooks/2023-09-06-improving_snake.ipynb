    "The first step to improving your snake game is changing your controls from the simple-minded, horrendous arrow keys to the magnificent, angelic WASD keys. Not only are these the optimal controls for any game, but it's a simple solution to fixing the problem in which when you use arrow keys to move your snake, the website scrolls with the snake!\n",
