    "If you'd like to understand the code behind the game a bit better or better yet, improve the game, consult ChatGPT. ChatGPT is great at both explaining code and improving upon it, making the games more interactive and enjoyable. It's important to note, in this process, do not blindly copy and paste code from ChatGPT. Try understanding what is going on as such experience will serve you later down the road."
