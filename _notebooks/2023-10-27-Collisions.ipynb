    "### Plan\n",
    "Collisions is how we will detect interaction between enemies and obstacles with our player. We plan to do this by using axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). It's a mathematical way of detecting collisions between multiple objects. It's typically used for rectanglular and square hitboxes, perfect for what we are trying to accomplish. While our sprites aren't rectangular, as you'll know from the hitbox blog, they use rectangles for collision detection."

This can be replaced with ore meaningful code, such as deploying a Game Over screen or causing the player to lose health.\n",

    "### Holistic View\n",
    "Now, at the time of writing this, we have a strong understanding on how hitboxes and collisions work and have implemeneted such into our game. Two key components in having interaction between multiple objects. Now that we have this foundation for interation, we just have to implement what we have planned for it. Spikes, enemies, etc. Perhaps when colliding with enemies, decrease the health of player or just make them instantly die and make a Game Over Screen pop up. These are all much more feasible ideas thanks to the additional code that we have now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions is just one small, but critical part of having a good game. But taking an even more restropective view of the situation is how one's experience with coding collisions tests many different parts of their knowledge, making them in the end, much better than before. That is the most holistic way to approach this, and perhaps the most accurate way as well."
