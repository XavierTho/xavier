Thankfully for us, JavaScript makes randomizing things simple and intutive and I'll show you how the method they provide can be used to make two classic games. Rock Paper Scissors & Flip a Coin.\n"

The exact logic to how this is done is out of a scope for this guide, but it's here to show you how powerful this one function can be and inspire you to have your own ideas.\n",
