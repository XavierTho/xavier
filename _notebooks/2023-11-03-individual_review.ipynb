    "### Collisions & Hitboxes\n",
    "Hitboxes and collisions, as we all know, are an essential asset for having a game. From pong to the most complex of modern games, without collision and hitbox detection, there can be no game. So knowing such, I took it upon myself to design a system in which could be used in order to detect collision, as we were planning to have interaction between a player & an enemy. The exact details on the subject won't be covered here as it was already talked about in more detail in the blogs linked at the bottom. However, a summary will be provided here and what was learned along the way.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we'll talk about hitboxes. Hitboxes are given by default to sprites, however, it's a common theme that these sprites don't have an accurate hitbox relative to their size. Take a look below. It's a screenshot of our default player hitbox which is obviously much bigger than the player, hence causing a problem. To solve this issue, we have to manipulate/create properties within the player & enemy to make a custom hitbox.\n",

Now, we just have to create another function to make sure the hitbox of the player is continually overlayed onto the player's current position.\n",

The code checks the positioning of the sides of each object and uses that information to presume whether or not the two objects are touching each other. If they are touching (the conditions are met to deem such so), then code will be run dictating what should happen in the event of a collision. Our code, when the player and enemy touch, causes the game to end."

These additions often come up to solve minor or major problems, one such problem affected the animation of the player.

They allow an experience to be unique and every time, which engages the users whom play the game.\"* Unfortunately, our game wasn't at the point where we could add such features.\n",
